## Task: `gen_plan_evaluation_1` (terminal_claude_agent)

### [1] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-07-30 12:48:14 UTC

````
<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EVALUATION

EVALUATION
Evaluate experiment results with metrics, statistical analysis, and validity checks.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any evaluation library), isolated workspace, gradual scaling matching experiment.
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.

</skills>

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The evaluation executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Spectral-Predictability-Driven Online Weighting (Validation Study)
hypothesis: >-
  Time series where spectral predictability Ω correlates with optimal linear-vs-nonlinear ensemble weighting can be identified
  via spectral analysis on rolling windows. A monotone weighting function α(Ω) can be learned on held-out validation data
  and applied at test time without model retraining. However, this approach remains UNVALIDATED on real benchmarks; multivariate
  extension, superiority over error-based weighting, and optimality of monotone weighting are unproven. Core contribution
  is establishing feasibility via rigorous experiments on M4/PEMS/ETT with confidence intervals and statistical significance
  testing. Univariate scope only—multivariate is deferred.
motivation: >-
  Recent work (Wang et al. 2025, Feng et al. 2026) shows spectral predictability Ω and Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP)
  reliably indicate which model TYPES work best (transformers beat baselines in high-Ω regimes). However, practitioners still
  deploy fixed ensembles, losing the ability to adapt as data characteristics shift. The core insight is: predictability doesn't
  just tell us which model to pick once—it tells us dynamically HOW to weight an ensemble. Linear methods exploit regularity
  efficiently; nonlinear methods handle chaos. This bridges recent theoretical advances in forecastability with practical
  online forecasting, enabling zero-retrain adaptation.
assumptions:
- >-
  Spectral properties of short windows (e.g., 100-200 points) are stable enough to predict the next forecast horizon's difficulty
- >-
  Linear and nonlinear forecasters make meaningfully different errors on regular vs. irregular data (no redundancy in predictions)
- >-
  Computational cost of spectral analysis (O(N log N)) is negligible compared to model inference
- >-
  The optimal weighting function between linear and nonlinear methods is approximately monotone in Ω (higher Ω → higher linear
  weight)
investigation_approach: >-
  Construct a minimal two-component ensemble: (1) Auto-ARIMA or exponential smoothing as the linear baseline, (2) a small
  LSTM or ResNet as the nonlinear expert. For each forecast step, compute Ω (spectral predictability) on a rolling 128-point
  window. Map Ω ∈ [0,1] to blend weights α(Ω) ∈ [0,1] via a monotone function (e.g., logistic curve). Aggregate forecasts
  as α(Ω)·linear + (1−α(Ω))·nonlinear. Evaluate on standard benchmarks (M4, PEMS, ETTm datasets) with hold-out test periods
  where data properties shift. Compare against: (a) fixed 0.5/0.5 ensemble, (b) static per-series optimal weights, (c) recent
  adaptive ensembles (error-based weighting).
success_criteria: >-
  The spectral-adaptive ensemble achieves ≥3% lower test MSE than fixed-weight (0.5/0.5) ensemble on ≥70% of test sequences,
  especially on sequences where Ω shifts >0.2 between train and test. Gains are largest (≥5%) on 'regime-change' sequences
  (e.g., stationary→trending or vice versa). Computational overhead is <5% vs. static ensemble due to spectral computation.
related_works:
- >-
  Wang et al. (2025, arXiv:2511.08884): Spectral Predictability Ω as a model-selection indicator showing zero-shot transformers
  beat baselines when Ω is high. **Differs from our work**: Uses Ω for pre-training model selection, not for in-inference
  adaptive weighting within a single ensemble.
- >-
  Feng et al. (2026, arXiv:2509.23074): Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP) with band-specific and time-varying difficulty
  estimates; shows predictability drift. **Differs**: SCP is diagnostic (evaluation framework), not prescriptive for online
  forecasting; we use related principles operationally for real-time weighting.
- >-
  Catt (2026, arXiv:2603.20546): Forecastability profiles via mutual information across horizons; theoretical bounds on achievable
  loss. **Differs**: Information-theoretic framing; no algorithmic contribution to adapt methods.
- >-
  Hammam et al. (2025): Adaptive ensemble weighting (ARIMA + XGBoost) via convex optimization. **Differs**: Their weighting
  is static per-series, trained offline; ours is dynamic, responding to in-stream spectral drift.
- >-
  Adhikari & Jain (2015): Neural network combining weights for linear/nonlinear forecasts. **Differs**: Offline learned combiner;
  no spectral-property-based adaptation.
- >-
  Elliott & Timmermann (2002): Optimal forecast combination under regime switching. **Differs**: Assumes discrete regimes;
  our approach is continuous, spectral-grounded.
inspiration: >-
  The inspiration spans three cross-domain sources: (1) **Signal Processing** — spectral coherence and frequency-domain regularity
  have long been used in control theory to diagnose system stability; here we apply the same principle to forecast method
  selection. (2) **Adaptive Filtering** — from control/signal processing, the idea that when the input signal's statistics
  change (captured by spectral shift), the optimal filter structure changes too. (3) **Ecologically-inspired adaptation**
  — in ecology, organisms partition effort based on environmental harshness; similarly, an ensemble can partition effort (weight)
  between conservative (linear) and exploratory (nonlinear) strategies based on data 'roughness' (low Ω = rough/chaotic; high
  Ω = smooth/regular).
terms:
- term: Spectral Predictability (Ω)
  definition: >-
    A scalar metric (Wang et al., 2025) quantifying the concentration of a time series' power spectrum. High Ω (close to 1)
    indicates strong frequency-domain structure (periodic, regular); low Ω (close to 0) indicates diffuse, irregular signal.
    Computed in O(N log N) via Fast Fourier Transform.
- term: Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP)
  definition: >-
    An extension of Ω (Feng et al., 2026) that measures predictability separately within each frequency band and across time
    windows, revealing which frequency bands and time periods are forecastable, and which are chaotic.
- term: Adaptive Ensemble Weighting
  definition: >-
    Dynamically adjusting the contribution of different forecasting models based on real-time data characteristics, rather
    than using a fixed pre-computed weight.
- term: Regime Shift / Concept Drift
  definition: >-
    A change in the underlying statistical properties or generating process of a time series over time (e.g., shift from stationary
    to trending, or change in variance), captured by a shift in spectral properties Ω or SCP.
- term: Linear Forecaster
  definition: >-
    A forecasting method that captures only linear dependencies in the data (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing). Computationally
    efficient and interpretable; excels on regular, periodic series.
- term: Nonlinear Forecaster
  definition: >-
    A neural network or machine learning method that learns nonlinear patterns (e.g., LSTM, ResNet, Transformer). More expressive
    but requires more data and computation; excels on chaotic or complex series.
summary: >-
  We propose a spectral-adaptive ensemble that monitors the spectral predictability (Ω or SCP) of incoming data in real time
  and dynamically reweights a fixed two-component ensemble (linear + nonlinear forecasters) without retraining. High-predictability
  regimes favor linear components (efficient, parsimonious); low-predictability regimes favor nonlinear components (flexible,
  expressive). This leverages recent advances in forecastability measurement (Wang 2025, Feng 2026) operationally, enabling
  zero-retrain online adaptation across regime changes.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refined from claimed solution to validation framework; narrowed to univariate; made assumptions explicit
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reframed as VALIDATION STUDY, not validated solution. All paper results are currently placeholders without error bars, confidence
  intervals, or statistical significance tests.
- >-
  Narrowed scope to UNIVARIATE time series only. Multivariate extension (needed for PEMS/ETT proper) explicitly deferred as
  future work, not addressed by current method.
- >-
  Made core UNVALIDATED assumptions explicit: (1) Monotone weighting relationship in Ω (no ablation vs. non-monotone neural
  network), (2) T_w=128 optimal (no data-dependent justification; needs empirical grid search), (3) Hyperparameter tuning
  strategy underspecified (no explicit grid bounds, validation methodology).
- >-
  Repositioned novelty honestly. Spectral-adaptive is a proactive leading-indicator alternative to reactive error-based weighting
  (Sun et al.), not 'first in-inference application'—Wang et al. already use Ω for pre-training selection; applying at inference
  is incremental.
- >-
  Revised success criteria from specific claims (3% MSE on 70% of sequences) to demonstrating the hypothesis structure: (1)
  Does Ω correlate with optimal weighting on target models? (2) Can we learn α(Ω) on validation data? (3) Does it beat fixed
  0.5/0.5 and error-based baselines? Require 95% CIs, paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes.
- >-
  Added urgent experimental validation agenda: (1) Execute actual M4/PEMS/ETT experiments with explicit dataset specification
  (M4 sample seed, PEMS sensors, ETT target), reported confidence intervals and p-values; (2) Ablate monotone vs. non-monotone
  (neural network f_θ(Ω)) weighting to test core assumption; (3) Empirically justify rolling window size via grid sweep {32,50,100,128,256,512};
  (4) Benchmark computational overhead on real hardware (CPU: Intel/AMD; GPU: A100/RTX).
- >-
  Acknowledge major limitation upfront: Method handles univariate input only. Modern forecasting benchmarks (PEMS as multivariate
  traffic, ETT as multivariate energy) require per-channel Ω or SCP-based aggregation not implemented. Treating as separate
  univariate series loses spatial/correlative structure.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: evaluation_iter2_dir2
type: evaluation
objective: >-
  Analyze experiment results with statistical rigor, error quantification, stratified comparisons, and validity checks to
  determine if spectral-adaptive achieves claimed improvements and under what conditions.
approach: >-
  Process method_out.json from experiment artifact. Compute: (1) Central estimates with 95% confidence intervals (bootstrap)
  for MSE and MAPE across all test sequences; (2) Paired t-tests vs. each baseline with Bonferroni correction (α=0.05/5 tests);
  (3) Effect sizes (Cohen's d, Hedge's g); (4) Proportion of sequences with >3% improvement with 95% binomial CI (Wilson score);
  (5) Stratification by spectral regime: high Ω (>0.7), medium (0.4-0.7), low (<0.4)—report mean improvement per stratum;
  (6) Regime shift analysis: sequences with ΔΩ>0.2 (train→test shift)—MSE improvement vs. ΔΩ regression with slope, p-value,
  R²; (7) Lag analysis: quantify how many forecast steps until spectral-adaptive responds vs. error-based dynamic; (8) Ablation
  interpretation tables: window size (optimal T_w per dataset, MSE vs T_w plots), weighting form (MSE/variance/speed comparison),
  monotone vs. non-monotone (cases where each wins, failure mode analysis); (9) Multivariate assessment: report how many examples
  are univariate vs. multivariate, per-sensor results for PEMS (spatial variation in gains), identify gap requirements for
  true multivariate extension; (10) Computational overhead: wall-clock measurements on CPU (Intel/AMD) and GPU for FFT, sigmoid,
  ensemble average, report relative overhead vs. LSTM inference. Output eval_out.json with tables, CIs, p-values, effect sizes,
  stratification results, lag metrics, ablation tables. Generate publication-ready figures: MSE improvement with error bars,
  stratified results by Ω regime, ΔΩ correlation plot, lag comparison (spectral vs. error-based), weighting form trade-offs,
  window size optimization curves, multivariate gap diagram.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for evaluation artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
</instructions><user_data>
User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_oxbmYex8-G2P/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task.

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above.

### [3] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-07-30 12:48:30 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
